<p>I was a member of a competitive dance team for 10 years. Throughout these years, I was team captain and overall divisional perfomrance captain. I spent a majority of my time after school and on the weekends practicing for competitions and at the studio. With my team, I have performed half time at the Barclay's Center and Madison Square Garden, in addition to auditioning for America's Got Talent. I have been trying to make time to dance here, but it has been very difficult with balencing school work. </p>
