		<h3><a href="https://shortstackeats.com/">Short Stack Eatary</a></h3>
		<p>One of my favorite brunch places in Madison is Short Stack. The location of the restaurant makes it very convinient and the hours of the restaurant are very accomodating. My go-to order is the trio with scrambeled, potatoes and sourdough toast. They have options for everyone at any time of the day to always keep you satisfied. </p>

		<h3><a href="https://ianspizza.com/">Ian's</a></h3>
		<p>Another one of my favorite lunch places in Madison is Ian's Pizza. My favorite type of food is Italian, so Ian's is the perfect spot. It has chopped salads and pizza and are open-late night. My favorite thing to get is a chopped salad and bread sticks. This is the perfect meal for any time of the day. </p>

		<h3><a href="https://www.foodtrucksin.com/city/madison_wi">Food Trucks</a></h3>
		<p> One of my favorite things about Madison is the food trucks everyday. When I don't know what I want I go to statestreet to the food trucks and walk around to get inspiration. They have such a variety of quality foods for a great price. The lines do get lengthy but they are worth the wait! My favorite truck is the spring roll one. </p>
