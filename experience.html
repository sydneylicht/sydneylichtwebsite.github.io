		<p>In high school through last year I was a brand ambassador for skin care and makeup company. Through my time I promoted new beauty products from an organic, cruelty-free makeup brand through online, social, and traditional marketing outlets. In addition, I also Worked at several pop-up shop locations and help spread awareness about the attributes of the brand by way of ‘street team’ marketing tactics. This experience allowed me to see new aspects of a brand that I had not been exposed to before.</p>

I also helped prepare reports and updates for current and new investor and marketing partner meetings. Finally, I asisted with design, branding, and marketing direction. This was my first real internship which opened me to a whole new world of job experience. Here, I witnessed the importance of work-place diversity. </p>
